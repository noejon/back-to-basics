# The Almighty To-Do List

## Welcome, Future Code Wizards

You’re about to embark on a journey to create something truly revolutionary: the To-Do List! Yes, it’s the pinnacle of productivity tools, the mighty organizer of tasks, and the humble servant of your chaotic life.

## Objective

Create a simple yet functional To-Do List app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This mini-project will teach you the basics of web development while giving you a sense of accomplishment (and something to cross off your own to-do list).

## Requirements

### 1. HTML

- A text input to add new tasks.
- A button to submit the new task.
- A list to display all the tasks.

### 2. CSS

- Basic styling to make it look presentable (we’re not designing the next Facebook here, but let’s not make it look like it’s from the 90s).
- Highlight completed tasks.

### 3. JavaScript

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Persist tasks in Local Storage (so your hard work doesn’t vanish when you refresh the page).

## Implementation

Here is the order I created things:

- Created header, main, footer.
- Made the footer sticky.
- Styled all that
- Added the  input and the button
- Styled all that
- Created an empty list.
- Added the javascript to create an item.
- Styled the item
- Add a button to mark the task as completed
